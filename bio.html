    These are some haiku
    About a person - Jenny -
    Whose site you are on

    She likes to ride bikes
    They are a tool for much change
    Social and scenic

    She works at her school
    At the Fletcher Library
    On the Tufts campus

    She wants to see change
    In early education
    In the public schools

    Critical thinking
    Is another tool for change
    In education

    She wants to soon build
    Educational tools for 
    These schools and classrooms

    Using CS as 
    A blueprint for these tools
    She also likes tools

    Can you tell?
